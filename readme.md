## Repo to use with book: build a large langague mode


### Langchain: Maybe a litle stage of this book.



### Chapter I

Encoder: A component that processes input sequences (like text) and transforms them into continuous numerical representations (vectors or embeddings) that capture the contextual meaning. Encoders read and analyze the entire input at once to create context-aware representations for each token.

Decoder: A component that takes encoded representations and generates output sequences (like text). Decoders use these representations to predict tokens one at a time in a sequential manner, with each prediction potentially influencing what comes next.

### BERT and GPT Definitions

**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based machine learning model developed by Google that uses a bidirectional training approach to language modeling. BERT reads text input in both directions simultaneously, allowing it to understand context more effectively by considering both words that come before and after each word in a sentence. This bidirectional context helps BERT excel at understanding the meaning and relationships between words in text.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: A series of transformer-based language models developed by OpenAI that are trained on vast amounts of text data to predict the next word in a sequence. GPT models process text in a unidirectional manner (left-to-right) and are primarily designed for text generation tasks. These models can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on prompts, making them powerful tools for various generative applications.

BERT=Bi-directional encoder representation from transfomers
GPT= Generative pre-trained for transformers

BERT=specialize in mask word prediction
GPT= generative texts (decoder)

### Key Differences Between BERT and GPT

| Feature | BERT | GPT |
|---------|------|-----|
| Architecture | Bidirectional (looks at entire context in both directions) | Unidirectional/Autoregressive (only looks at previous tokens) |
| Training Objective | Masked Language Modeling + Next Sentence Prediction | Next Token Prediction |
| Processing | Understands context from both directions | Generates text from left to right |
| Primary Purpose | Understanding (encoding) | Generation (decoding) |

### Use Cases

**BERT Use Cases:**
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing documents, emails, or customer feedback
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying people, organizations, locations in text
- **Question Answering Systems**: Extracting answers from documents based on questions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text
- **Information Retrieval**: Improving search relevance by understanding query intent

**GPT Use Cases:**
- **Conversational AI/Chatbots**: Creating human-like dialogue systems
- **Content Generation**: Writing articles, stories, marketing copy, etc.
- **Code Generation**: Creating programming code from natural language descriptions  
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing long documents while preserving key information
- **Creative Writing**: Assisting with stories, poems, scripts, and other creative content
